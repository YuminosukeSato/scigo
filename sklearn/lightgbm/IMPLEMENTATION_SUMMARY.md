        EarlyStoppingCallback(20, "l2", true),
        LearningRateSchedule(0.9, 50),
    )
trainer.Fit(X, y)
```

### Cross-Validation
```go
kf := NewKFold(5, true, 42)
result, _ := CrossValidate(params, X, y, kf, "mse", 10, true)
fmt.Printf("CV Score: %.4f (+/- %.4f)\n", 
    result.GetMeanScore(), result.GetStdScore())
```

### Histogram Optimization
```go
finder := NewOptimizedSplitFinder(params)
split := finder.FindBestSplit(X, indices, gradients, hessians, params)
```
